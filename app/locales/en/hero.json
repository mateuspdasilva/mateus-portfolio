  "note": "I architect and ship high-performance systems — from backend services and APIs to data pipelines, product features, and observability — end-to-end.\n I’ve led engineering across microservices, ML pipelines, observability frameworks, and performance-critical features, plus crafted elegant interfaces like this website.\n Pragmatic and impact-driven, I’m tool-agnostic and pick what fits best for the project’s optimal design and architecture."
